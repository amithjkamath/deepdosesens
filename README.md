## Overview

This project investigates the robustness of deep learning models for radiotherapy dose prediction in glioblastoma patients, focusing on how variability in organs-at-risk (OAR) segmentation affects model performance. We introduce a controlled perturbation framework to simulate realistic segmentation variations and assess their impact on dose prediction accuracy.

---

## Key Contributions

- **Controlled Perturbation Framework:** Developed a method to simulate realistic variations in OAR segmentations.
- **Robustness Assessment:** Analyzed how segmentation variability influences dose prediction.
- **Model Comparison:** Evaluated multiple deep learning models for robustness against OAR perturbations.

---

## Methodology

- **Data:** Glioblastoma patient CT scans, OAR segmentations, and corresponding dose distributions.
- **Perturbation Techniques:** Applied geometric deformations and noise to mimic segmentation variability.
- **Model Training:** Used CNN-based architectures trained on original segmentations and tested on perturbed data.
- **Metrics:** Evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Dose-Volume Histogram (DVH) differences, and other relevant metrics.
